## About

This is a little script using the `bz2` python library to compress our fast download server's files.

## Why

Source servers support `bz2` file compression which can allow to [divide by two](https://catchchallenger.first-world.info/wiki/Quick_Benchmark:_Gzip_vs_Bzip2_vs_LZMA_vs_XZ_vs_LZ4_vs_LZO) the size of the files.

Thus, custom models, materials and maps can be downloaded compressed which is way faster.
